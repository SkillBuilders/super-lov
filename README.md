# **SkillBuilders Super LOV**
### An Item Plug-in for Oracle Application Express (APEX)
### Update for APEX 5.0, June 2015

# Overview

## Intro

The built-in Popup LOV item in APEX can be a powerful tool when the number of possible selections
is too high for other item types that use LOVs, such as a select list. However, people often wish to
display more information when making a selection than this item type allows. In the past, developers
worked around this issue by either concatenating values in the display column or by creating a
custom solution.

Custom solutions provided the ultimate flexibility but required a lot of knowledge and were not
always easily transferable to other items, pages, or applications. The SkillBuilders Super LOV plug-in is
designed to make these issues a thing of the past while providing a rich, web 2.0 experience.

## Features at a Glance

* Multiple column LOV support
  * Displays multiple columns when LOV is open
  * Allows column level selection and searching when LOV is open
  * Allows selection of a display column and a return column
  * Allows for additional column to item value mappings
* Rich client-side user interface
  * Skinned with jQuery UI themes (currently 25 themes to choose from)
  * Includes transition effects with adjustable speeds
  * Uses a modal dialog over a traditional popup window
  * Select from a variety of loading images, or use your own

# Installation and Configuration

## Installation

### Standard

With this installation package there is a plug-in installation file named:

  * item__type_plugin_com_skillbuilders_super_lov.sql.
  
Navigate to “Shared Components > Plug-ins” and click **Import >** . From there you can follow the menu
to upload and install the plug-in using the file above. After the plug-in has been installed successfully
you will be redirected to the plug-in edit screen.

### Optional Performance Upgrades

After installing the plug-in you can make it more performant by either using packaged code, files on
the file server, or both.

If you wish to test the package based code, simply compile the package spec and body and add the
package name and a period to the beginning of each of the function names in the Callbacks region.
At that point you could even safely remove the contents of the PL/SQL Code in the Source region.

If you wish to test the files on the apps server, simply copy the files in the "server" directory to a
directory on the apps server and change the File Prefix attribute of the plug-in to point to that
directory.

Example: 
  If you copy the contents of "server" to **/images/plugins/apex_super_lov_3_0**,
  Then set the "File Prefix" attribute of the plug-in to **#IMAGE_PREFIX#plugins/apex_super_lov_3_0/**

## Configuration

Once installed, this plug-in can be used as a native APEX component. When creating a new item, select
the “Plug-ins” option and then choose the plug-in on the next page.

Here’s a sample query that could be used for the LOV. Notice how column aliases are used to
generate formatted column headings.

```
SELECT empno AS "Emp No.",
  ename AS "Employee",
  job AS "Job",
  sal AS "Salary"
FROM emp
```
See Configuration Settings for details on how the application and component settings affect the plug-in.

## Configuration Settings

### Application Settings

Application settings are used to configure all instances of a plug-in within an application. These
settings are accessed by editing the plug-in within the Shared Components. This plug-in has the
following application settings:

_**Search Type**_

Use this setting to control how search strings are used to filter the LOV result set.

_**Loading Image Type**_

Use this setting to choose between a default or custom loading image. The loading image is
displayed when the LOV is opened, before the result set appears. There are a number of default
loading images that can be used (see Loading Image next) but you can use your own as well.

_**Loading Image**_

Use this setting to specify which loading image you would like to use. Based on the Loading Image
Type selection, you will either choose from a number of default images or you will specify the
path/name to a custom image.

_**Effects Speed**_

Use this setting to specify the speed at which the modal dialog should perform certain effects such as
sizing, resizing, and fading. Selecting “instant” will essentially disable any effects.

_**Use Clear Confirm**_

Use this setting to enable or disable the Clear Confirm feature. Clear Confirm requires the user to
click the clear button twice to clear the selected value. This is done to help prevent accidental
clearings that would require the LOV to be reopened.

_**When No Data Found Message**_

Use this setting to specify what message should be displayed to users when the LOV query fails
to retrieve any results.

### Component Settings

Component settings are used to configure an individual instance of a plug-in within an
application. These settings are accessed by editing the component as you would a native APEX
component. This plug-in has the following component settings:

_**Use Value Validation**_

Use this setting to enable or disable the Value Validation feature. Value Validation will re-check the
submitted value against the LOV. If the value is not found then the validation will fail and the user
will see a validation error message.

_**Dialog Title**_

Use this setting to explicitly set the title of the dialog. If no value is supplied then the item’s label will
be used.

_**Item Display & Return Columns**_

Use this setting to specify which column should be used for the item’s display value and which column
should be used for the item’s return value. The value should be a comma separated pair of numbers
where the numbers refer to the column in the LOV query. The first number should be the display
column and the second number should be the return column. The display column will be used as the
default search column.

_**Searchable Columns**_

Use this setting to specify which columns should be displayed in the select list of columns that allows
users to filter the LOV result set. The value should be a comma separated list of numbers where the
numbers refer to columns in the LOV query. If no value is supplied then all columns will be searchable.
If a value is supplied then only those columns will be searchable. The display column (defined via Item
Display & Return Columns) will always be searchable and will be the default search column.

_**Hidden Columns**_

Use this setting to specify which columns should be hidden when the LOV is displayed. The value
should be a comma separated list of numbers where the numbers refer to columns in the LOV query. If
no value is supplied then all columns will be visible. The display column (defined via Item Display &
Return Columns) will always be visible.

_**Map from Columns**_

Use this setting to specify which columns should be used to map values to other items (see Map To
Items). The value should be a comma separated list of numbers where the numbers refer to columns
in the LOV query. Both visible and hidden columns can be used when mapping to other items.

_**Map to Items**_

Use this setting to specify which items should be used when mapping values from columns (see
Map From Columns). The value should be a comma separated list of item names. The order of the
items in Map To Items should match the order of the columns in Map To Columns.

_**Enterable**_

Use this setting to make the item "enterable". If enterable, users will be able to type in the actual
textbox. The display column (defined via Item Display & Return Columns) will be the default search
column against which values entered will be validated. If one match is found then the display and
return values will be set accordingly. If no match is found or multiple matches are found the modal
dialog will open so that the user can make a selection.

_**Max Rows Per Page**_

Use this setting to specify the maximum number of records that should be displayed at one time.

_**Show Null Values As**_

Use this setting to specify how null values should be displayed in the result set.

## Methods

The disableItem and enableItem methods can be used to programmatically disable or enable the
item. Example(s):

```
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('enable');
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('disable');
```

The hideItem and showItem methods can be used to programmatically hide or display the item and
its label. Example(s):

```
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('hide');
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('show');
```

The hideRow and showRow methods can be used to programmatically hide or display the item, its
label, as well as any other elements that exist in the same table row. Example(s):

```
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('hideRow');
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('showRow');
```

The getValuesByReturn and setValuesByReturn methods can be used to programmatically fetch
return values and set the item using the return values. getValuesByReturn will return a JSON object
with the results from the fetch. setValuesByReturn goes a step further using the return values to set
the display and return values for the item. Example(s):

```
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('getValuesByReturn', '101');
  $('#P1_ITEM_NAME').apex_super_lov('setValuesByReturn', '999');
```
